How to Use
Step 1: Authentication
Upon visiting the app, click the "Connect to Spotify" button.
You’ll be redirected to Spotify's login page to authenticate and authorize the app to access your data.
Once authenticated, the app will show your top tracks and artists.
Important: Email Whitelisting
The app is currently in development mode, so access is restricted to whitelisted users only.
You won’t be able to use the app until your email is whitelisted. Please provide your email address, and I'll whitelist it to grant access.
Development Mode Limitation
In development mode, Spotify limits the number of users who can authenticate with your app. This is to ensure that the app is thoroughly tested before it's made available to a broader audience. If you would like to use the app, please reach out with your email so I can add you to the list of allowed users.
